## Code of Conduct

## Reporting Bugs
Because autoimpte is in rapid development, bugs are inevitable. We do our best to avoid them through testing and squash them quickly if they arise. That being said, we rely on users to help us find bugs that we missed! Here are some pointers for reporting bugs.

#### Before Reporting
* Make sure the bug occurs when using the master branch
* Check other active branches to ensure the bug is not being worked on or already fixed and slated for a future release
* Comb through the [Issues Board](https://github.com/kearnz/autoimpute/issues) to see if the bug has already been identified

#### When Reporting
* Follow the guidelines specified from our issue template for bugs
