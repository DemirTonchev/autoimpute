## Getting Started
If you're completely new to `autoimpute`, read through our [README](https://github.com/kearnz/autoimpute/blob/master/README.md). To learn more about using the package and review sample use cases, check out our [tutorials](https://kearnz.github.io/autoimpute-tutorials/).

## Code of Conduct
Before continuing, please read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/kearnz/autoimpute/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Our code of conduct extends to questions, issues raised, pull requests, and code itself. 

## Reporting Bugs
Because `autoimpute` is in rapid development, bugs are inevitable. We do our best to avoid them through testing and squash them quickly if they arise. That being said, we rely on users to help us find bugs that we missed. Here are some pointers for reporting bugs.

#### Before Reporting Bugs
* Make sure the bug occurs when using the master branch.
* Check other active branches to ensure the bug is not being worked on or already fixed and slated for a future release.
* Comb through the [Issues Board](https://github.com/kearnz/autoimpute/issues) to see if the bug has already been identified.
* For errors, make sure that `autoimpute` is not raising the error as expected behavior.
* For unexpected behavior, determine if any implicit assumptions from `autoimpute` logic produce the output.

#### When Reporting Bugs
* Follow the guidelines specified from our [Bug Report Issue Template](https://github.com/kearnz/autoimpute/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md)
* If you're unsure who should act on this bug, assign it to `kearnz` by default.

#### After Reporting Bugs
* Stay involved! Monitor the issue thread. Be prepared to respond to comments & questions we may have.
* Keep us updated! If you have more info to provide after the fact, follow up with us in a comment.

## New Features
Missing data imputation is a vast field. While we hope to cover as much as we possibly can, it'd be impossible for us to do it all. As noted in the [Pull Requests](#pull-requests) section, we are preparing to accept pull requests shortly. In the mean time, you can submit a request for a new feature to the issues board.

#### Before Suggesting New Features
* Make sure the feature does not exist within any active branch. 
* If the feature exists in a stale branch, get in contact with us first.
* Comb through the [Issues Board](https://github.com/kearnz/autoimpute/issues) to see if the feature has already been requested.

#### When Suggesting New Features
* Follow the guidelines specified from our [New Feature Issue Template](https://github.com/kearnz/autoimpute/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md)
* If you're unsure who should act on this feature request, assign it to `kearnz` by default.

#### After Suggesting New Features
* Stay involved! Monitor the issue thread. Be prepared to respond to comments & questions we may have.
* Keep us updated! If you have more info to provide after the fact, follow up with us in a comment.

## Pull Requests
We've open sourced `autoimpute` early on so colleagues and students can use the package. We have completed what we feel is the first phase of `autoimpute`, and we are preparing to accept pull requests from those who want to contribute. 

A pull request template is coming shortly! Once ready, we'll update the contributing doc with our guidelines for pull requests. We'll include our expectations regarding coding style and, depending on what you're working on, coding requirements for the pull request to be accepted. Until then, feel free to request new features, following the guidelines specified in the [New Features](#new-features) section.
