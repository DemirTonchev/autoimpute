# Contributing to AutoImpute
Welcome to AutoImpute! We appreciate your desire to contribute, and we're excited to see how you can add to or improve our project! We've outlined some guidelines to make contributing easy and ensure the contribution process is smooth. Note that this project is in its ***(very) early stages***, so the project will change continuously until our first stable release.

## Getting Started
If you're completely new to `autoimpute`, read through our [README](https://github.com/kearnz/autoimpute/blob/master/README.md). To learn more about using the package and review sample use cases, check out our [tutorials](https://github.com/kearnz/autoimpute-tutorials/tree/master/tutorials).

## Code of Conduct
Before continuing, please read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/kearnz/autoimpute/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Our code of conduct extends to questions, issues raised, pull requests, and code itself. 

## Reporting Bugs
Because AutoImpute is in rapid development, bugs are inevitable. We do our best to avoid them through testing and squash them quickly if they arise. That being said, we rely on users to help us find bugs that we missed. Here are some pointers for reporting bugs.

#### Before Reporting Bugs
* Make sure the bug occurs when using the master branch.
* Check other active branches to ensure the bug is not being worked on or already fixed and slated for a future release.
* Comb through the [Issues Board](https://github.com/kearnz/autoimpute/issues) to see if the bug has already been identified.
* For errors, make sure that AutoImpute is not raising the error as expected behavior.
* For unexpected behavior, determine if any implicit assumptions from `autoimpute` logic produce the output.

#### When Reporting Bugs
* Follow the guidelines specified from our [Bug Report Issue Template](https://github.com/kearnz/autoimpute/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md)
* If you're unsure who should act on this bug, assign it to `kearnz` by default.

#### After Reporting Bugs
* Stay involved! Monitor the issue thread. Be prepared to respond to comments & questions we may have.
* Keep us updated! If you have more info to provide after the fact, follow up with us in a comment.

## New Features
Missing data imputation is a vast field. While we hope to cover as much as we possibly can, it'd be impossible for us to do it all. As noted in the [Pull Requests](#pull-requests) section, we cannot accept pull requests until after our first official release. But until then, you can specify new features you'd like us to work on, and once we've released, you can help tackle those features with us and become a contributor.

#### Before Suggesting New Features
* Make sure the feature does not exist within any active branch. 
* If the feature exists in a stale branch, get in contact with us first.
* Comb through the [Issues Board](https://github.com/kearnz/autoimpute/issues) to see if the feature has already been requested.

#### When Suggesting New Features
* Follow the guidelines specified from our [New Feature Issue Template](https://github.com/kearnz/autoimpute/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md)
* If you're unsure who should act on this feature request, assign it to `kearnz` by default.

#### After Suggesting New Features
* Stay involved! Monitor the issue thread. Be prepared to respond to comments & questions we may have.
* Keep us updated! If you have more info to provide after the fact, follow up with us in a comment.

## Pull Requests
We've open sourced AutoImpute early on so colleagues and students can use the package. That being said, we still have a long way to go before our first official, stable release. Therefore, we **will not accept pull requests until after our first release**. Once the release is complete, we welcome new contributors to collaborate with us. Until then, feel free to request new features, following the guidelines specified in the [New Features](#new-features) section.

Once we are ready to start accepting pull requests, we'll update the contributing doc with our guidelines for pull requests. We'll include our expectations regarding coding style and, depending on what you're working on, coding requirements for the pull request to be accepted.
